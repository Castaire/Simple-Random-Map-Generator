// COLOR GUIDE //

> main sprite :
	- inner ring : new Color(255, 255, 255, 255);	// plain white
	- bouncer 	 : new Color(164, 56, 99, 255);	 	// wine burgundy
	- atom 		 : new Color(255, 206, 0 , 255);  	// bright orange

> main sprite lighting : 
	- head light : 	new Color(255, 0, 69, 255); 		// red-pink
	- rings 	 : 	new Color(0, 34, 255); 				// blue




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// NOTE: our base size is 32 x 32 pixels -> do not go lower than this
		 if you are creating larger sprites, please have its size be a multiple of
		 	32 x 32 !!!



// NOTE: when importing new png sprites / tile resources, do the following:
	1. put it in the Resources folder
	2. click on the resource and set 'Pixels per Unit' to 32

		^ especially necessary for tiles because otherwise it will NOT fill up a 
			tile cell properly when made into a tile and added to the main tilemap



// Z-positioning guide //

z = -5 : camera(s) ONLY
z = -1 : light sources ONLY (even if they are attached to sprites)
z = 0  : sprites
z = 1  : tiles and tilemap

	*** it is kind of difficult to have these z-values set as individual layers,
		as layers in Unity tends to correspond to differences in the y-value 
		(and not the z-value) ***



// Q: how to make 2D sprites / objects react to lighting?
   A: add 'sprite_lightreact' material in the 'Materials' folder to the sprite / object
   		- mainly, you just need a material that has its shader set to 'Sprite/Diffuse'



// Tilemap Tips //
	- Open the 'Tile Palette' from Window->2D->Tile Palette
	- Drag in 32x32 px tile resources (usually in .png)

	- To add tiles to tilemap:
		i) 		select tile in tile palette
		ii) 	select the 'brush' option in the palette (or press 'B')
		iii)	go to the Scene window and select the 'Grid' object
		iv) 	hold the left mouse button to drag and "paint" the tile on :)
	
	- To delete tiles in the tilemap:
		^ same as steps i) to iv) above, EXCEPT: 
			- select the 'eraser' option in the palette (or press 'D')
